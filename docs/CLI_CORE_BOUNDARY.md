# pccx-lab CLI/core boundary

This document defines the controlled boundary used by command-line,
desktop, editor-adjacent, CI, and future integration workflows.

## Principle

**CLI/core first. GUI second.**

The desktop shell is a thin surface over reusable core commands and
status contracts. GUI-visible workflow state should be reachable
through the same Rust core or CLI boundary that a headless consumer can
call. The GUI may render richer panels, but it must not become a
separate workflow logic island.

## Current boundary artifacts

| Artifact | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `pccx-lab status --format json` | available | Deterministic lab-status JSON from `pccx-core`. |
| `pccx-lab theme --format json` | experimental | Minimal semantic theme-token contract. |
| `pccx-lab workflows --format json` | available | Descriptor-only workflow catalog from `pccx-core`. |
| `pccx-lab workflow-proposals --format json` | available | Proposal-only workflow previews from `pccx-core`. |

| `pccx-lab run-approved-workflow <proposal-id> --format json` | disabled-by-default pilot | Fixed allowlisted runner pilot; blocked unless explicitly enabled. |
| `pccx-lab analyze <file> --format json` | early scaffold | File-shape diagnostics only. |
| `pccx-lab diagnostics-handoff validate --file <path> --format json` | read-only validator | Launcher diagnostics handoff schema reader. |
| `lab_status` Tauri command | available | GUI reads the same core status struct. |
| `theme_contract` Tauri command | experimental | GUI reads the same core theme-token struct. |
| `workflow_descriptors` Tauri command | available | GUI reads descriptor-only workflow metadata. |
| `workflow_proposals` Tauri command | available | GUI reads proposal-only workflow previews. |
| `workflow_result_summaries` Tauri command | available | GUI reads summary-only workflow result metadata. |

No stable plugin ABI is promised. No MCP runtime is implemented. No
IDE or launcher runtime integration is implemented by this foundation.

## status command

```
pccx-lab status [--format json]
```

`status` emits a deterministic JSON object matching
[`docs/examples/run-status.example.json`](examples/run-status.example.json).
It is host-only and static by design: it does not scan the workspace,
load traces, probe hardware, call providers, launch editor bridges, or
run verification scripts.

Top-level fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `schemaVersion` | Status schema marker, currently `pccx.lab.status.v0`. |
| `labMode` | Current operating mode, currently `cli-first-gui-foundation`. |
| `workspaceState` | Host status with `traceLoaded: false` for this static boundary. |
| `availableWorkflows` | Reusable command or core boundaries visible to the GUI. |
| `pluginState` | Placeholder plugin state with `stableAbi: false`. |
| `guiState` | Minimal native-editor style surface metadata. |
| `diagnosticsState` | Current diagnostics command and scope. |
| `evidenceState` | Conservative evidence markers for hardware, timing, inference, and throughput. |
| `limitations` | Human-readable constraints carried with the status output. |

The GUI status panel renders this data through Tauri IPC. It does not
shell out to arbitrary commands and does not duplicate workflow logic.

## theme command

```
pccx-lab theme [--format json]
```

`theme` emits the early theme-neutral presentation layer contract in
[`docs/examples/theme-tokens.example.json`](examples/theme-tokens.example.json).
The contract is intentionally small:

- `background`
- `foreground`
- `mutedForeground`
- `border`
- `panelBackground`
- `accent`
- `danger`
- `warning`
- `success`

Current preset names are:

- `native-light`
- `native-dark`
- `compact-dark`
- `quiet-light`

These are semantic slots only. They are not a heavy design system and
do not promise a stable UI contract.

## workflows command

```
pccx-lab workflows [--format json]
```

`workflows` emits a deterministic descriptor-only catalog matching
[`docs/examples/workflow-descriptors.example.json`](examples/workflow-descriptors.example.json).
Each descriptor explains what a workflow boundary is for, who may
consume it later, and which safety constraints apply.

The catalog is intentionally non-executing. It does not spawn commands,
read trace files, scan project roots, probe hardware, call providers,
open network connections, start MCP runtimes, or touch the FPGA repo.
Every entry currently carries `executionState: "descriptor_only"` and
`evidenceState: "metadata-only"`.

Descriptor fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `workflowId` | Stable descriptor identifier for this early catalog. |
| `category` | Safe grouping such as `status`, `diagnostics`, `trace`, `report`, `plugin_candidate`, or `future_mcp_candidate`. |
| `availabilityState` | Current readiness marker such as `available`, `experimental`, `early-scaffold`, or `planned`. |
| `executionState` | Always `descriptor_only` in this boundary. |
| `inputPolicy` | What input the descriptor accepts. Current descriptors accept no runtime input. |
| `outputPolicy` | Bounded metadata shape expected from this boundary or a future proposal. |
| `safetyFlags` | Static flags documenting the no-execution, no-shell, no-hardware, no-network posture. |
| `futureConsumers` | Intended future consumers such as GUI, CI/headless worker, future IDE/launcher consumer, or future MCP/tool consumer. |
| `limitations` | Explicit constraints carried with the descriptor. |

## workflow-proposals command

```
pccx-lab workflow-proposals [--format json]
```

`workflow-proposals` emits deterministic proposal-only previews matching
[`docs/examples/workflow-proposals.example.json`](examples/workflow-proposals.example.json).
These objects explain what a later approved run would do, without doing
it now.

The preview keeps command information structured. `fixedArgsPreview` is
a bounded token array, not a raw shell command string. Some proposals
require no runtime input; others mark `approvalRequired: true` because a
future boundary would need an approved local input before any execution
could be considered.

Proposal fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `proposalId` | Stable preview identifier for this early proposal catalog. |
| `workflowId` | Descriptor id that the proposal is derived from. |
| `proposalState` | Always `proposal_only` in this boundary. |
| `approvalRequired` | Whether a later run would require explicit approval. |
| `commandKind` | Structured command category, not a shell string. |
| `fixedArgsPreview` | Bounded argument-token preview for fixed CLI boundaries. |
| `inputSummary` | Human-readable summary of required future input. |
| `outputPolicy` | Bounded output shape expected from a future approved run. |
| `expectedArtifacts` | Empty for the proposal listing boundary. |
| `limitations` | Explicit non-execution constraints. |

The proposal command does not execute workflows, read user paths, create
artifacts, run verification, start MCP runtimes, call providers, or
touch the FPGA repo.

## workflow-results command

```
pccx-lab workflow-results [--format json]
```

`workflow-results` emits deterministic summary-only result metadata
matching
[`docs/examples/workflow-results.example.json`](examples/workflow-results.example.json).
It is intentionally not a full log cache. The summaries omit
`stdoutLines`, `stderrLines`, full logs, generated artifacts, hardware
logs, provider logs, and FPGA repo paths.

Summary fields:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `proposalId` | Fixed proposal id or a redacted placeholder for rejected input. |
| `workflowId` | Workflow id associated with the summary. |
| `status` | Summary status such as `blocked`, `rejected`, `completed`, `failed`, or `timed_out`. |
| `exitCode` | Exit code when a run result exists; `null` for blocked or rejected entries. |
| `startedAt` / `finishedAt` | `not-recorded` until a later cache records timestamps. |
| `durationMs` | Duration carried from a run result, or `0` for deterministic metadata entries. |
| `summary` | Short human-readable outcome. |
| `truncated` | Whether underlying returned output was truncated before summarization. |
| `redactionApplied` | Whether ids or returned output required redaction. |
| `outputPolicy` | Always summary-only for this boundary. |

The current list is deterministic metadata, not a persistent execution
cache. A later cache must preserve the same summary-only posture unless
a separate bounded log contract is reviewed.

## run-approved-workflow command

```
pccx-lab run-approved-workflow <proposal-id> [--format json]
```

`run-approved-workflow` is a disabled-by-default allowlisted runner
pilot. Without explicit local runner enablement, it emits a blocked JSON
result matching
[`docs/examples/workflow-runner-blocked.example.json`](examples/workflow-runner-blocked.example.json).

Default config:

```text
workflowRunner.enabled=false
workflowRunner.mode=disabled
workflowRunner.timeoutMs=30000
workflowRunner.maxOutputLines=120
```

When explicitly enabled for local validation, the pilot accepts only
known proposal ids whose command is a fixed pccx-lab argument list:

- `proposal-lab-status-contract` -> `status --format json`
- `proposal-theme-token-contract` -> `theme --format json`
- `proposal-workflow-descriptor-catalog` -> `workflows --format json`
- `proposal-workflow-proposal-catalog` -> `workflow-proposals --format json`

The runner uses process execution without shell interpolation. It does
not accept raw commands, arbitrary args, project paths, trace paths,
hardware settings, provider settings, network settings, launcher
settings, IDE settings, or FPGA repo paths. Results include exit code,
duration, bounded stdout/stderr lines, truncation status, and redaction
status.

## analyze command

```
pccx-lab analyze <path> [--format json]
```

`analyze` emits a diagnostics envelope for a SystemVerilog file. It is
an early scaffold for host-side file-shape checks only.

| Check | Code | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| File missing or unreadable | `PCCX-IO-001` | error |
| File content is empty | `PCCX-SHAPE-001` | error |
| No `module` declaration found | `PCCX-SHAPE-002` | error |
| `module` present but `endmodule` missing | `PCCX-SCAFFOLD-003` | error |

It does not perform full semantic parsing, hardware verification,
provider calls, MCP calls, or GUI-only checks.

Exit codes:

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| 0 | No error-severity diagnostics |
| 1 | At least one error-severity diagnostic |
| 2 | I/O failure or unsupported CLI usage |

Fixtures for integration testing:

- `fixtures/ok_module.sv`
- `fixtures/missing_endmodule.sv`
- `fixtures/empty.sv`

## diagnostics-handoff command

```
pccx-lab diagnostics-handoff validate --file <path> [--format json]
```

`diagnostics-handoff validate` reads a local launcher diagnostics
handoff JSON file and emits a deterministic validation summary. It is a
future-consumer boundary for pccx-llm-launcher data, not an execution
bridge.

The validator checks:

- required handoff fields
- diagnostic severity and category values
- launcher/model/runtime descriptor references
- JSON file, stdout JSON, and read-only local artifact transport sketches
- no telemetry, no automatic upload, and no write-back flags
- no runtime execution, hardware access, provider calls, network calls,
  MCP, LSP, or marketplace flow flags
- absence of private path, secret, model weight path, and unsupported
  claim markers

The command does not execute pccx-llm-launcher, load plugins, probe
hardware, call providers, upload telemetry, write files, or start GUI
logic. It also avoids echoing the supplied file path in the JSON summary.

The checked example is
[`docs/examples/launcher-diagnostics-handoff.example.json`](examples/launcher-diagnostics-handoff.example.json).
Fixture sync with pccx-llm-launcher is manual while this boundary remains
pre-compatibility.

## GUI foundation

The current GUI addition is only a compact verification dashboard panel
for status and theme metadata. It reads:

- `pccx_core::status::lab_status` through the `lab_status` Tauri command.
- `pccx_core::theme::theme_contract` through the `theme_contract` Tauri command.
- `pccx_core::workflows::workflow_descriptors` through the
  `workflow_descriptors` Tauri command.
- `pccx_core::proposals::workflow_proposals` through the
  `workflow_proposals` Tauri command.
- `pccx_core::results::workflow_result_summaries` through the
  `workflow_result_summaries` Tauri command.
- `pccx_core::runner::workflow_runner_status` through the
  `workflow_runner_status` Tauri command.

The panel does not run FPGA flows, provider calls, MCP flows, IDE
bridges, launcher bridges, or arbitrary shell commands.

## Deferred work

| Area | Current position |
|---|---|
| Full GUI workflows | Deferred until reusable CLI/core commands exist. |
| Plugin ABI stability | Not promised. |
| MCP runtime | Not implemented in this foundation. |
| Editor or launcher runtime bridge | Not implemented in this foundation. |
| Hardware inference and throughput status | Not claimed by status output. |
| Timing-closure status | Not claimed by status output. |

The intended direction is a quiet engineering UI over CLI/core data,
not a separate workflow engine or a separate product surface.
