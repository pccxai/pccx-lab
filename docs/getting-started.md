# Getting Started

> A 5-minute tutorial for first-time users.
> Structured as a VS Code-style `walkthroughs` contract in three steps:
> (1) launch pccx-lab, (2) load the sample `.pccx`, (3) open Flame Graph +
> Waveform.

## Prerequisites

- A working pccx-lab build (`cargo tauri dev` or a release binary).
- Sample trace `hw/sim/fixtures/smoke.pccx` produced by running
  `hw/sim/run_verification.sh` once inside the sibling
  [pccx-FPGA](https://github.com/pccxai/pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260)
  checkout. Run that first if you do not yet have a trace.

---

## Step 1 — Launch pccx-lab

```bash
cd ui
npm install            # first time only
npx tauri dev
```

On launch you will see:

- **Title bar + menu bar** — File / Edit / View / Trace / Analysis /
  Verify / Run / Tools / Window / Help.
- **Tab strip** — Timeline / Flame Graph / Waveform / System Simulator /
  Memory Dump / ….
- **AI Copilot panel** (docked right; `Ctrl+\`` to toggle).
- **Bottom Panel** (Log / Console / Telemetry; `Ctrl+J` to toggle).

The right-hand activity bar surfaces the Copilot and Telemetry quick-toggles. Every icon-only button carries an `aria-label`
so the shell is fully screen-reader navigable (WCAG 2.2 SC 2.1.1 /
2.4.3).

---

## Step 2 — Load the sample `.pccx`

Two entry points:

1. **Menu** — `File ▸ Open .pccx…` (`Ctrl+O`).
2. **Auto-load** — the app attempts to load `dummy_trace.pccx` at
   startup. On success, a green `trace loaded` badge appears to the
   right of the tab strip.

To load a real pccx-FPGA simulation result, pick:

```
../pccx-FPGA-NPU-LLM-kv260/hw/sim/fixtures/smoke.pccx
```

The status bar populates `cycles` and `cores` once the trace is
decoded.

## Step 3 — Open Flame Graph + Waveform

### Flame Graph

Click the **Flame Graph** tab.

```

Controls:

- `Ctrl + scroll` — zoom the time axis.
- Drag — pan.
- **Find Bottleneck** — calls the `detect_bottlenecks` IPC and
  surfaces the dominant contended window with an AI recommendation.
- `Ctrl + Shift + D` — toggle diff mode against a second loaded run.

### Waveform

Click the **Waveform** tab. To open a `.vcd` directly, use
`File ▸ Open VCD…` (`Ctrl + Shift + O`).

```{image} /_static/screenshots/waveform.png

```

Controls:

- `Alt + click` — A cursor; `Shift + click` — B cursor.
- Right-click — add / remove bookmark.
- `Ctrl + B` — jump to the next bookmark.
- `Ctrl + scroll` — zoom.

---

## Full shortcut list

Press **`?`** or **`F1`** anywhere in the app to open a modal that
lists every registered shortcut.

The shortcut registry is a single source of truth
(`ui/src/useShortcuts.ts`); combined with the `aria-label` pass
(WCAG 2.2 SC 2.1.1 Keyboard, WAI-ARIA 1.2 §5.2.8.4 `aria-label`) you
can drive the full IDE without a mouse.

## Next steps

- `docs/pccx-format.md` — binary layout of the `.pccx` container.
- `docs/verification-workflow.md` — the end-to-end xsim → `.pccx` → UI
  verification pipeline.
- `docs/modules/node-editor.md` — tour of the Blender-grade node editor.
